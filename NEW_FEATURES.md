# Shinobi Survivors - New Features Added

## ðŸŽ® Enhanced Controls

### WASD Movement
- **W** - Move Up
- **A** - Move Left  
- **S** - Move Down
- **D** - Move Right
- Arrow keys still work alongside WASD for maximum accessibility

### Mouse Controls
- **Left Click** - Melee Attack (attacks toward mouse cursor)
- **Right Click** - Shuriken Attack (shoots toward mouse cursor)
- **Middle Click** - Dash (dashes toward mouse cursor)
- **Context menu disabled** - no annoying right-click menu popup
- Mouse actions use cursor direction, keyboard actions use movement/facing direction

All keyboard controls remain functional - players can use keyboard only, mouse only, or a combination of both!

## ðŸ§­ Navigation System

### Smart Objective Arrows
- **Blinking yellow arrow** appears around the player pointing to the next objective
- Arrow updates dynamically as the player moves
- Pixelated art style matches the game's aesthetic
- Automatically progresses through objectives:
  1. DASH ABILITY
  2. SHURIKEN
  3. SHURIKEN UPGRADE  
  4. BOSS ARENA
  5. ASSASSIN BOSS (once spawned)

### Objective Indicators
- **Icons for pickups**: Shows actual dash/shuriken icons near the arrow (scaled to 0.4x for perfect size)
- **Text for boss**: Small red text "BOSS" appears near the arrow when pointing to boss
- Icons/text positioned 25 pixels beyond the arrow tip (moves and rotates with arrow direction)
- Only shows when far from objective (>100 pixels for arrow visibility)
- Dynamically follows the arrow as it points in different directions
- Uses the same assets as cooldown UI for consistency

### Smart Hiding
- Arrow disappears when within 100 pixels of target
- Completely hidden when objective is reached
- Removes when boss is defeated
